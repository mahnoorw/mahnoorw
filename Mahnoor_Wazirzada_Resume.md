## Hi, I'm Mahnoor Wazirzada! I am a UI/UX designer, writer, and digital artist :wave:

I started my career path in healthcare because I passionately wanted to use my Psychology degree to help others. Working at the University of Iowa Child Psychiatric Unit was an incredible experience. I had the opportunity to work with and learn from children living with mental health conditions. During my time as a psychiatric nursing assistant, I gained an even broader sense of human individuality. Every person has unique lived experiences and perspectives that make their journeys different. 

I transitioned to user experience design because I’ve always been a passionate creative with a strong sense of empathy and passion for helping others. For years, I didn’t know how to merge the two into a career path. Having discovered UX Design, I can create cohesive design while leveraging the skills I gained in healthcare, to build empathic and equity-focused user experiences.

My relationship with design is ever-growing and always will be, the sky is not the limit.
